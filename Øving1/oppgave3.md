What is concurrency? What is parallelism? What's the difference?
    Concurrency is the decomposability of a program. Concurrency means that the result of a computing should be the same even if the program is executed out of order.
    Paralellism is performing several computations is parallel.
    The difference is that splitting up a computation is paralellism and performing several independent calculations at once is concurrency
